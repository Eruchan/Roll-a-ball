# Roll-a-ball

#UNITY 5.1.1f1 NEEDED

The goal of the game is to become the very best and catch all the Pokémon.

In this game you play as the Pokéball and roll around trying to catch all the Pokémon in the level but you have to be careful!
There is a time limit because a Pokéball cannot roll around indefinitely, so you have to hurry up. The player/you should also watch out
for mudddy areas slowing the Pokéball down which makes it a lot more difficult to catch the Pokémon! 
Furthermore each Pokémon type has a different way of moving: Bulbasaurs move in a straight line so they are the easiest to catch. 
Charmanders move in a circle, Squirtles move randomly a certain area and Zubats also move in a straight line but since they are flying and
the player needs to use the jumping platforms to reach the Zubats.
